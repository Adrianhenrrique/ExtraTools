# ExtraTools
ExtraTools is a Slimefun4 Addon I'm creating to supply useful tools which, although unnecessary, are certain to improve your Slimefun experience.

These tools are a combination of suggestions from the community to which, as an experienced Slimefun player, I decided to add: merging community driven ideas and my personal take on ways to expand on them leads to a nice mix which is aimed at giving the feeling all items from this Addon are not a new branch of content but rather contribute in integrating already existing mechanics giving an overall boost in cohesion between the parts, resulting in utilities for server Staff and Slimefun dev purposes or simply making it more enjoyable to experience the great changes Slimefun4 already brings to the game.
