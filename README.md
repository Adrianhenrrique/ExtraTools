# ExtraTools
ExtraTools is a Slimefun4 Addon I'm creating to supply useful tools which, although unnecessary, are certain to improve your Slimefun experience.

These tools are a combination of suggestions from the community to which, as an experienced Slimefun player, I decided to add: merging community driven ideas and my personal take on ways to expand on them leads to a nice mix which is aimed at giving the feeling all items from this Addon are not a new branch of content but rather contribute in integrating already existing mechanics giving an overall boost in cohesion between the parts, resulting in utilities for server Staff and Slimefun dev purposes or simply making it more enjoyable to experience the great changes Slimefun4 already brings to the game.

## Contents
### Items
- Hammer - Pulverizes cobblestone, gravel and dirt into finer pieces;
### Machines
- Gold Transmuter - Turns SF gold into vanilla gold and vice versa;
- Electric Composters - Like a Composter, but electric (duh!);
- Cobblestone Generator - Passively creates cobble if powered;
- Vaporizer - Salt and Sulfate production;
- Concrete Factory - Turns Concrete Powder into Concrete, 8 at a time;
- Pulverizer - Turns blocks into sand (allows cobblestone -> sand automation! No need to choose in Slimefun's config which recipe would work for the Electric Ore Grinder, you can have both with this).
